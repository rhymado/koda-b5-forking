# WELCOME TO FORKING

## HOW TO COLLABORATE

1. Fork the Repository: Begin by forking this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Create a Branch: Make a new branch for the feature you want to implement. Choose a clear and descriptive name for your branch.
3. Create Your Folder: Inside the tasks/ directory, create a folder with your nickname. Make sure it's all lower case and does not contain spaces, numbers, or symbols.
4. Include Your File: Add your feature file to the folder you created. Don't forget to include your file in index.js and call your feature from there.
5. Commit and Push: Once you have completed your feature, commit your changes and push the branch to your forked repository.
6. Submit a Pull Request: Create a pull request (PR) from your branch to the main branch of this repository. Make sure to include a clear description of the feature you've implemented.

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

- Lint Your Files: Ensure all your files pass the linting process before submitting a Pull Request.
- Run Lint Command: Use the following command to lint your files:

```bash
npm run lint
```

- Auto-fix Issues: If there are any linting issues that can be automatically fixed, use the command:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

- Review and Commit: After fixing linting issues, review your changes, commit, and push them before making a Pull Request.
- Careful with auto-formatter: Make sure to only modify your tasks, not other folders/files
